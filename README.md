## Technologies
React, JavaScript, and random user generator API
## Future
Getting sort by gender, or even acending or decending order working so it's fully functional.
## Usage
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
As an employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
